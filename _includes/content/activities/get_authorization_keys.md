To get an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API:

1.  Go to [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).
2.  Click **Sign Up** in the top navigation bar and create an account.
3.  After you sign up, your API key is sent to the email address you provide. You can also find it on the Developer Dashboard in the site. Return to the OpenWeatherMap homepage and click **Sign in**.
4.  After signing in, you'll see the developer dashboard. Click the **API Keys** tab (highlighted in the screenshot below).

5.  Copy the key to a place you can easily find it.

(Note: It can take an hour or so for a new OpenWeatherMap API key to activate. If you have trouble with your key, use one of the keys [listed here](http://idratherbewriting.site/apikeys). Put your name next to the key you're using.)
