I've provided information about Stoplight in two other places in this course:

* [Create an OpenAPI specification document using Stoplight Studio's visual editor](pubapis_openapis_quickstart_stoplight.html)
* [Stoplight — visual modeling tools for creating your OpenAPI spec](pubapis_stoplight.html)

Here I include a short demo of how Stoplight renders the OpenAPIWeatherMap OpenAPI specification. Following the same API we've been using in this course, here's what the /weather endpoint looks like in Stoplight:

This sample API doesn't include many endpoints, so it might be more instructive to see some other samples of Stoplight listed on their [Case Studies page](https://stoplight.io/case-studies/). For direct links to the documentation mentioned in case studies, explore the following:

* [Zoom API docs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api)
* [Nutanix API docs](https://www.nutanix.dev/api-reference/)
* [MediaMath API docs](https://apidocs.mediamath.com/)
* [AppointmentPlus API docs](https://appointmentplus.api-docs.io/v1/overview)
* [BigCommerce API docs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs)
* [Namely API docs](https://developers.namely.com/1.0/getting-started/introduction)

Note that Stoplight lets you mix both the API reference documentation along with the conceptual content, so it provides a more seamless experience across all of your documentation.
