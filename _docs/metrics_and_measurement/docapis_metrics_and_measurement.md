Metrics and measurement addresses ways to measure API documentation quality and how to track your progress on improvement the documentation. You can use both a first-level checklist and a second-level checklist to review essential components of documentation and how your API docs stack up. Then you can convert your assessments into scores that provide more measurable approaches for tracking your impact and contribution to the docs.
