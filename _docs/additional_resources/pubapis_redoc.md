See the more detailed [getting started tutorial for using Redocly](pubapis_redocly_tutorial.html). The content here is a brief tutorial on how to use the free version of Redoc to just publish your OpenAPI spec.

[Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) is a popular display framework for the OpenAPI as well and is a favorite by many API gurus. Redoc started out as a API doc site for [Rebilly docs](http://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI) but with many customizations evolved into its own unique framework. Redoc provides a three-panel layout made popular by companies such as Stripe.

The makers of Redoc recently spun off into their own company (Redoc.ly) and are developing a more robust hosted solution offering (see [From ReDoc to Redoc.ly](https://redoc.ly/blog/from-redoc-to-redocly)). As with both Stoplight and Swagger, Redoc offers both free and pro versions to adjust to your needs. And you can add topics beyond just reference docs.

{: .note}
Redocly offers robust tools for authoring and publishing API docs using the command-line and docs-as-code workflows. For a fully tutorial, see [Redocly tutorial -- authoring and publishing API docs with Redocly's command-line tools](pubapis_redocly.html). The tutorial on that follows below is a simple way to use the community edition of Redoc.
