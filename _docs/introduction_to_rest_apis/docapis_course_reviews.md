> I cannot thank you enough for this site. I started a new job and my role is to create API documentation. While I've created docs for a RESTful API in the past, it's been a while, the industry has changed/matured, and I certainly didn't understand all of the concepts. In addition, I've always worked with a traditional HATs (Frame and then Flare), and I just recently learned about static site generators and markdown. As the new and only writer, I need to figure out my tools and deliverables. THIS SITE HAS BEEN INVALUABLE! Thank you so much.

> Just an email to thank you for the wonderful API course on your site. I am a long-time tech writer for online help that was recently assigned a task to document a public API. I had no experience in the subject, but had to complete a plan within a single sprint. Luckily I remembered from your blog posts over the years that you had posted material about this.
>
> Your course on YouTube gave me enough information and understanding to be able to speak intelligently on the subject with developers in a short timeframe, and to dive into tools and publishing solutions.
>
> Thanks for the service that you do for tech writers - we are lucky to have an industry leader like you to provide information and expertise, such as I found in your API materials. Thanks. (November 2017)

> I love this course (I may have already posted that)—it's the best resource I have come across, explained in terms I understand. I've used it as a basis for my style guide and my API documentation.... (January 2017)

### Dave Wilks:

> Tom, this course is great. I'm only part way through it, but it already helped me get a job by appearing fluent in APIs during an interview. Thanks for doing this. I can't imagine how many volunteer hours you've put into helping the technical communication community here. (January 2017)

### Anonymous:

> Hi Tom, I went through the whole course. Its highly valuable and I learned a bunch of things that I am already applying to real world documentation projects. ...  I think for sure the most valuable thing about your course is the clear step by step procedural stuff that gives the reader hands-on examples to follow (its so great to follow a course by an actual tech. writer!) (January 2017)

> I have just started your course on API documentation, its very interactive, in fact I am creating newsletters comprising the topics I learn from your site and plan to use them as a part of my portfolio (hope its OK).

> Hi Tom, I've been learning a lot from your tutorial and made a donation for your efforts. I currently work as a technical writer for a telecom hardware company, but I'm interested in moving into the API documentation area. I took some programming classes in college quite a while ago, learning Pascal, but I'd like to refresh my programming knowledge and skills.	(June 2017)

> I'm nearly through the course. It's quite rich - loving the thoroughness (thanks again!). I initially intended to dive in, get stuff on Swagger, and pop out, but decided to stay for the entire ride.

> Tom, Thanks a ton for this helpful tutorial. It certainly helped me get clarity on using swagger.... (January 2016)

> First, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge of API documentation on this website! I’m a technical writer and I’ve recently been asked to document an API for a startup. Your site has been invaluable in helping me understand how REST APIs work, and what constitutes good API documentation... (May 2017)

> Enjoyed your API documentation course as I was recently told we are adding API's to our next release of our software. What would be really helpful is to have the entire course available as a PDF, so it can be printed out without wasting so much paper on comments, links, etc. Thanks a lot. (May 2017)
